@spacegreg, the only profiles from apparmor-profiles which have been adapted to NixOS so far are those in abstractions/ and tunables/, see nixos/modules/security/apparmor/includes.nix, they’re commonly used with the include keyword in applications’ profiles (eg. include <abstractions/base>).

Most of the content of profiles should be written in Nixpkgs’ pkgs/ in a postInstall defining an apparmor output. Those profiles use includes and apparmorRulesFromClosure as much as possible, and include a local/ customization (eg. include <local/bin.transmission-daemon>) which will then be optionally created by NixOS to add rules to the profile if need be (in this example, by setting security.apparmor.includes."local/bin.transmission-daemon").

Currently application profiles should be defined using security.apparmor.policies."bin.transmission-daemon".profile to include the profile from Nixpkgs (eg. include "${pkgs.transmission.apparmor}/bin.transmission-daemon"), but thinking about it, we should maybe load those profiles from environment.systemPackages like .desktop files, using environment.pathsToLink and environment.extraSetup.

The term policies in security.apparmor.policies does not really match something in AppArmor, I just needed a term to gather under the same name, the three options enable, enforce (whether to forbid or just report unallowed access), and profile (the rules for some executable paths).

The value of a Nix expression can be inserted into a character string with the dollar-sign and braces (${ }).
